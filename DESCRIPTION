Title: Access the suite of IRIS Web Services
Description: The Incorporated Research Institutions in Seismology (IRIS)
    now uses a web-based client for database access (DHI, for example, is
    retired). The client, named Web Services (WS), is easy to use,
    flexible, and robust; this package provides an interface to it from
    within the R environment. One should note the following:
    *  The current state of development can be considered
    to be `incremental': as more functions are
    added to access the various components of the WS (and tested!), the
    package will be more ``complete". The major version number
    corresponds to the lowest version of the IRIS WS documentation,
    and minor versions correspond to package revision numbers.
    *  It may be obvious, but this package will not be very useful if
    a stable connection to the internet is not available!
    *  Code suggestions and contributions are highly welcome.
