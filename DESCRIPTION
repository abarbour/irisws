Type: Package
Title: Access the suite of IRIS Web Services
Description: The Incorporated Research Institutions in Seismology (IRIS)
    now uses a web-based client for database (DHI, for example, is
    retired) access, named Web Services (WS).  The WS system is
    simple, and robust; this package provides an interface to it.
    The current state of development can be considered
    to be 'incremental': as more functions are
    added to access the various components of the WS (and tested!), the
    package will be more 'complete'.  Code suggestions and contributions are
    highly welcome.
    A note on the package version: the major version
    corresponds to the lowest version of the IRIS WS documentation,
    and minor versions will be package revision numbers.
